    title:'Video Analytics and Edge computing',
    content:`Our reliable platform based on the NXP iMX8 and Xilinx Kira enables fast deployment of powerful edge computing and Video Analytics. 
    We have experience in developing the product for Video recording and analytics. The product we design utilizes protocols like GMSL and FPD 
    for data transfer which uses lower voltage swings to transmit data at high speed, which can realize point-to-point or point-to-multipoint 
    transmission. These technologies have a higher video data transmission rate, up to Gbps, and audio data transmission is clear, 
    which has more advantages than traditional serial interface transmission. The LVDS and CSI protocols support the Camera and Displays 
    compatible with Embedded Linux.`,
